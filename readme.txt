Email batcher that takes all the emails that would normally get sent out individually, compiles them into just one email, then sends it out once a day.  A daily digest, if you will.

Inbox Relief will compile all administrative emails (comment/trackback, user registration, etc.) into just one email sent out every day at midnight.  The main purpose is to relieve your inbox of lots of emails.

Going on vacation? You can also tell Inbox Relief to suspend all emails until further notice.  Re-enable upon your return.
